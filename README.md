# Group 47 - Global Patterns and Correlates of Happiness: Exploring Regional Variations and Identifying Key Intervention Areas

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We are interested in examining the World Happiness Report 2015–2022 dataset to learn more about the critical elements that influence happiness levels and to pinpoint areas that may use some help in promoting fair and long-lasting well–being results. More specifically, we want to investigate the association between happiness levels and economic variables like GDP per capita, social support, and life expectancy, as well as other demographic variables like age, gender, and educational attainment.

Identifying any notable geographical variations in happiness levels and associated variables is another area of study, as is investigating how these variations could affect general levels of happiness and life satisfaction. Also, we intend to look at the relationships between many elements that affect overall happiness, such as wealth, social support, freedom, altruism, and corruption, as well as pinpoint critical areas for action to enhance well-being results.

With this dataset, we have the opportunity to create a user-facing dashboard that will enable users to explore various features and variables as well as spot patterns and trends in the data.
