In order to learn more about the connections between these important economic indicators, our team is interested in examining the "Inflation, Interest, and Unemployment Rate" dataset. With regard to various income levels and nations, our initiative seeks to offer a thorough analysis of these variables.

We aim to understand the causes of unemployment, interest rates, and inflation through our analysis, as well as the effects that prospective policy changes might have on these variables. In order to present a clear and illuminating picture of the data, we will make use of regression analysis, data visualization, and descriptive statistics.

We also intend to use the dataset to create a user-friendly dashboard that will let consumers explore the facts and conclusions we have drawn. Ultimately, we think that our study will offer insightful information that policymakers, economists, and researchers may utilize to comprehend and address global economic concerns.
