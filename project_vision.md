# Project Vision

The goal of our project is to identify critical factors that influence happiness levels and pinpoint areas that need intervention to promote fair and sustainable well-being outcomes. We aim to investigate the correlation between happiness levels and economic variables like GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, and demographic variables like age, gender, and educational attainment.

Through our analysis, we hope to provide policymakers, researchers, and other stakeholders with data-driven insights to promote well-being outcomes. Our team plans to develop a user-facing dashboard that will enable users to explore different variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

By using correlation analysis techniques, we aim to identify critical factors for intervention and enhance well-being outcomes. Our project is a step towards a better understanding of global patterns and correlates of happiness, and we are committed to contributing to the advancement of knowledge in this area.
