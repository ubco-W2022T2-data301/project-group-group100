# Project Vision

The goal of this study is to identify the connections between the rates of inflation, interest, and unemployment in nations with three different income distributionsâ€”low, mid, and high. We hope to help decision-makers develop sound financial policies by offering insightful information about how changes in one rate may affect the others through our research and regression models. Our effort is a step in the direction of a more thorough comprehension of the global economy and will act as a foundation for future study and advancement. In order to build a better future for everyone, we are committed to investigating these links.
