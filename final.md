# Final Report

### Introduction:

Our project aimed to analyze global happiness patterns and correlates using the World Happiness Report 2015-2022 dataset. We examined the relationship between happiness levels, economic factors, and demographic variables, identified geographical variations, and pinpointed critical intervention areas. Our goal was to offer insights into key happiness-contributing factors and promote data-driven policy-making to enhance well-being outcomes worldwide. We deemed our project significant due to its potential to inform policymakers and stakeholders about critical happiness-influencing elements and identify intervention areas to promote well-being outcomes.

### Exploratory Data Analysis: 

During our initial exploratory data analysis, we uncovered interesting happiness patterns and trends across various countries and regions. We utilized visualization techniques, such as bar charts, scatter plots, and choropleth maps, to investigate the relationships between happiness scores and the dataset's different contributing factors. These visualizations enabled us to identify potential areas for further investigation.

The first chart is a horizontal bar chart that groups the top 10 happiest countries by region and color-codes them accordingly. This chart helps us understand which regions exhibit the highest overall happiness levels and compare the top 10 countries from each region. By doing so, we identified regions that may require more attention regarding overall well-being and key intervention areas.

The second chart is a stacked horizontal bar chart displaying the factors contributing to overall happiness in the top 10 happiest countries. Identifying the most impactful contributing factors allowed us to gain insights into which areas require more attention and key intervention areas. This chart was useful for answering our research question by visually representing overall happiness contributing factors in the top 10 happiest countries.

Upon analyzing the available data, we inferred that social support is positively and strongly correlated with happiness scores. The correlation between these two variables can be considered moderate to strong, with a significant number of data points ranging from 0.8 to 1.0.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that social support is a critical determinant of individual well-being and happiness. Social support can be defined as emotional, instrumental, or informational resources provided by individuals' social networks. These resources can help individuals cope with stress and adversity, enhance their sense of belonging, and foster positive relationships.

By analyzing the chart, it is clear that mean happiness scores vary across regions over time, with North America and Western Europe consistently exhibiting high scores. To investigate the factors contributing to these regions' higher happiness levels, we conducted a comparative analysis of various metrics, such as economic indicators, social support systems, health outcomes, and environmental factors. This analysis can provide valuable insights into promoting well-being and happiness in other regions and potentially leading to more equitable global happiness levels.

### Question 1 + Results
**Is there a significant correlation between different factors that contribute to overall happiness, such as income, social support, freedom, generosity, and corruption, and how can this correlation be used to identify key areas for intervention? Additionally, what evidence-based interventions could be implemented to enhance these key areas and promote sustained and equitable well-being outcomes over time?**

We created visualizations, such as scatter plots and correlation matrices, to analyze the relationships between happiness scores and contributing factors. Our findings indicated strong positive correlations between happiness scores and GDP per capita, social support, and life expectancy. Conversely, weaker correlations were found between happiness and generosity or perceptions of corruption.

Our analysis suggests that interventions focusing on enhancing economic prosperity, social support networks, and health outcomes can significantly improve overall happiness levels. Some evidence-based interventions to consider include:

1. **Economic prosperity**: Implementing policies that promote economic growth, job creation, and social mobility can improve living standards and enhance overall well-being.
2. **Social support networks**: Strengthening social connections through community-based programs, mental health support, and social services can foster a sense of belonging and enhance well-being.
3. **Health outcomes**: Investing in quality healthcare, health promotion, and preventive measures can lead to improved physical and mental health, contributing to higher happiness levels.

### Question 2 + Results
**How do happiness levels vary geographically, and are there any discernible patterns or trends in the distribution of happiness across the globe?**

We used choropleth maps to visualize the geographical distribution of happiness levels. The maps demonstrated that regions such as North America, Western Europe, and Oceania consistently exhibit high happiness scores, whereas regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and parts of Eastern Europe and Central Asia display lower scores.

These findings suggest that significant geographical disparities in happiness exist. To address these disparities and promote equitable well-being outcomes, policymakers and stakeholders should consider implementing region-specific interventions that address the unique challenges faced by each region.

### Conclusion:

In conclusion, our project provided valuable insights into global happiness patterns and correlates, highlighting key areas for intervention. Our findings suggest that economic prosperity, social support networks, and health outcomes play significant roles in determining overall happiness levels. Therefore, evidence-based interventions targeting these key areas can promote sustained and equitable well-being outcomes worldwide. Additionally, the identified geographical disparities in happiness warrant region-specific interventions to address unique regional challenges and foster global happiness equity.

By using data-driven approaches, policymakers and stakeholders can make informed decisions to enhance well-being and improve the quality of life for individuals worldwide. Our project's findings contribute to the ongoing conversation around happiness and well-being, emphasizing the importance of addressing both global and regional factors that influence happiness levels.

### Future Research Directions

Although our project provided valuable insights, there are several opportunities for future research to explore further:

1. **Longitudinal analysis**: Examining trends in happiness and its correlates over time can provide insights into the temporal dynamics of happiness and its determinants. This can inform targeted interventions that adapt to evolving contexts and challenges.
2. **Subnational analysis**: Investigating happiness patterns and contributing factors at subnational levels (e.g., cities, states, provinces) can reveal additional insights into intra-country disparities and potential intervention points.
3. **Cultural factors**: Exploring the role of cultural factors in shaping happiness perceptions and experiences can offer a more nuanced understanding of well-being across different societies.
4. **Policy impact analysis**: Assessing the impact of specific policies and interventions on happiness outcomes can help identify best practices and refine policy recommendations.

### Limitations

Our study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings:

1. **Data quality**: The happiness scores and contributing factors are based on survey data, which may be subject to biases and measurement errors. Additionally, data availability varies across countries, which can affect the comprehensiveness of our analysis.
2. **Causality**: The correlations identified in our study do not imply causality. Further research is needed to establish causal relationships between the contributing factors and happiness outcomes.
3. **Unmeasured factors**: Our analysis focused on a limited set of factors, which may not capture the full complexity of happiness determinants. Other factors, such as political stability, environmental quality, and cultural values, could also play a role in shaping happiness levels.

Despite these limitations, our project contributes to a growing body of research on happiness and well-being, providing valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders seeking to enhance quality of life worldwide.
