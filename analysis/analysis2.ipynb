    "I am personally interested in looking through the information and examining the inflation, interest, and unemployment rates for nations and countries with low-income economies. I'm interested in learning more about the connections between these three economic indicators and how they interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, I intend to examine the data and discover economic trends and policies. Thus understanding the underlying causes of low-income countries' high rates of inflation, interest rates, and unemployment would help me better comprehend the possible effects of changing policy on these metrics. Through this analysis, I hope to produce an analysis that is helpful to policymakers, economists, and researchers in tackling the issues these economies are facing."
